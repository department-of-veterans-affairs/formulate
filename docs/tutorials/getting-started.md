# Getting Started
Welcome to Formulate!

For now, Formulate is just a light layer on top of Formik for building single-page forms which can be [embedded inside existing applications](formulate/how-to-guides/how-to-integrate-with-old-forms.html) or used in a stand-alone app.

To get started, check out the [Formik tutorial](https://formik.org/docs/tutorial) for more information on how to build single-page forms.
